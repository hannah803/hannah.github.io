title: Installing WSL and Docker on Windows 
---

## WSL

Windows Subsystem for Linux, lets developers install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, etc) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

## Install

```bash
wsl --install
```
